# R-Fundamentals
 

## 📌 Lab Work
**R Lab Assignment**  


## 🎯 Objective  
This lab focuses on hands-on practice with **R programming**, covering arithmetic operations, data structures, subsetting, and built-in functions in **RStudio**.  

## 📖 Topics Covered  
- Arithmetic operations and variable assignments  
- Built-in functions and data types  
- Data structures: Vectors, Matrices, Lists, Data Frames  
- Advanced practice: Logarithmic, Exponential, and Trigonometric functions  


## 📖 Tasks  
1. Perform and print addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication of two numbers.  
2. Convert temperature between **Celsius** and **Fahrenheit**.  
3. Convert an amount in **rupees** to **dollars** and vice versa.  
4. Swap values of two variables using a third variable.  
5. Swap values of two variables **without** using a third variable.  
6. Calculate and display the **volume of a cube** with given dimensions.  
7. Calculate and print **simple interest**.

## 📁 Folder Structure

This lab is organized into the following subfolders and files:

### 🔹 Directories

- **Basic_Syntax/**  
  Contains basic R syntax demonstrations including variables, operators, conditional statements, loops, and functions.

- **Correlation Analysis/**  
  Covers how to calculate and visualize correlation between numerical variables using functions like `cor()`, `cor.test()`, and plotting correlation matrices.

- **Curve Fitting/**  
  Demonstrates how to perform curve fitting using polynomial and non-linear regression techniques.

- **Regression Analysis/**  
  Includes examples of simple linear regression and multiple linear regression using R's `lm()` function. Also covers residual analysis and model interpretation.

- **Statistical/**  
  Contains various statistical analysis methods, including hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-squared tests), descriptive statistics, and data distribution checks.

### 🔹 File

- **Lab_4.ipynb**  
  A Jupyter Notebook version of the above scripts combining explanations, code, and visual outputs for easier understanding and execution.
